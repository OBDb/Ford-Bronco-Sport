    description: "The Ford Bronco Sport is a compact crossover SUV that shares the Bronco name and styling cues with its larger sibling but is built on Ford's C2 unibody platform shared with the Escape rather than a body-on-frame construction. Designed as a more road-friendly yet still capable off-road vehicle, it features distinctive styling with a boxy silhouette, round headlights, and 'BRONCO' lettering across the grille, clearly invoking the classic Bronco while establishing its own identity. Available exclusively as a four-door with a fixed metal roof featuring safari-style raised sections for improved headroom and cargo-carrying capability, it maintains a compact footprint suitable for urban environments. Powertrain options include a standard 1.5L EcoBoost three-cylinder producing 181 HP and an optional 2.0L EcoBoost four-cylinder with 250 HP in higher trims, both paired with an eight-speed automatic transmission and standard all-wheel drive. The Bronco Sport's off-road capability exceeds most competitors in its class, particularly in the Badlands trim which features an advanced all-wheel drive system with a twin-clutch rear differential, all-terrain tires, increased ground clearance, and underbody protection. The interior combines ruggedness with modern technology, featuring washable rubber flooring, an available 8-inch touchscreen with SYNC 3, and numerous clever storage solutions including a built-in bottle opener. A unique feature is the GOAT (Goes Over Any Terrain) mode selector, offering up to seven terrain management settings depending on the trim level. The Bronco Sport represents Ford's entry into the increasingly popular 'adventure crossover' segment, offering genuine off-road capability in a more accessible, daily-driver friendly package compared to the standard Bronco."
