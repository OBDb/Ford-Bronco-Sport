## Generations

The Ford Bronco Sport is a compact crossover SUV that shares the Bronco nameplate but is distinct from the larger body-on-frame Bronco. It has one generation to date:

- **First Generation (2021-present)**: Released alongside the sixth-generation Bronco in 2021, the Bronco Sport is built on Ford's unibody C2 platform shared with the Ford Escape and Maverick. It features retro-inspired styling similar to the larger Bronco but in a more compact footprint with front-wheel-drive-based architecture and standard all-wheel drive. The Bronco Sport offers two turbocharged engine options: a base 1.5-liter three-cylinder EcoBoost producing 181 horsepower and a 2.0-liter four-cylinder EcoBoost producing up to 250 horsepower (reduced to 238 hp for 2025). All models pair with an eight-speed automatic transmission and feature Ford's G.O.A.T. Modes (Goes Over Any Terrain) terrain management system. The lineup includes Base (2021-2023), Big Bend, Outer Banks, Badlands, Heritage, and Free Wheeling trims, with the off-road-focused Badlands featuring a twin-clutch rear differential with locking capability. For 2025, the Bronco Sport received its first major refresh with updated exterior styling, a new 13.2-inch touchscreen with SYNC 4 infotainment system, a 12.3-inch digital gauge cluster, and the introduction of the Sasquatch off-road package available on Outer Banks and Badlands trims.
